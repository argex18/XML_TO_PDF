- Solved several problems regarding to the pdf conversion.
- The txt folder was renamed to pdf folder
- In the new pdf folder (previously txt), converted pdf files are going to be saved in addition to the txt files 


This script is being developed for helping all those people that want to read the data of their
electronic invoice without using uncomfortable web services which don't often allow to user a reading
of multiple files. 

The data of the electronic invoice is going to be converted in txt format, which the user might also want to convert in pdf format. I'm also trying to make this done too.

#THE SCRIPT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE, SO EVERY KIND OF CONTRIBUTE WOULD BE REALLY GRATEFUL!

To use the script, you just have to do these simple operations:
    1 - pass in the "xml" folder of the script the file/s of the electronic invoice you want to convert
    2 - start the script by clicking on "xml_to_txt.py"
    3 - check the final result: if in the "txt" folder the files are present, the script correctly worked.
        If something went wrong, try to launch the script by using PowerShell or any other console and 
        check if any errors occur.

WARNING: EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO LAUNCH THE SCRIPT VIA CONSOLE A DEPRECATION WARNING ERROR WILL BE SHOWN.
	 THIS IS CAUSED BY A LINE OF CODE IN THE SCRIPT AND IT WON'T INTERFERE WITH THE WORKING OF THE SCRIPT.
	 DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO IT!
